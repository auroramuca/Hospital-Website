# Hospital Information Website – Diploma Project (Extra)

This repository contains a **simple static website** developed as part of a **side project** during my diploma thesis on network implementation and configuration for the regional hospital in Shkodra.

Although this website was **not part of the original thesis requirements**, it was created to provide the hospital with a **basic informational portal** about departments, services, and contact details.

## 🌐 Purpose

The website is intended to:

- Present basic information about the hospital
- Be used as an **internal landing page** in the staff or guest Wi-Fi
- Serve as a starting point for future web-based hospital services

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure
- **CSS3** – design and layout
- **JavaScript** – basic client-side interactivity

Creating this website helped me:

- Gain practical experience in **HTML/CSS/JS**
- Understand the structure of a basic web project
- Learn how to apply **self-guided learning** through online resources
- Go beyond the scope of the thesis to create additional value
